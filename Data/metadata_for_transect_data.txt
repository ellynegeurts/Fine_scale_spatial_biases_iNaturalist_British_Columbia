Meta data (simple) for the transect_data.csv file

# This file includes data entered from data sheets (up to column AA if open in excel, i.e. the "Comments" column), 
# with the last three columns ("obs", "taxa", "Est.dist.sc") are processed columns and appended to dataset

# Survey_ID:
Unique identifier for each transect. Format is the following ->
YEAR-MONTH-DAY followed by observer initials (JH, KM, LDC, TM) then time of day (M, A, E, N), then whether if on or off trail
Time of day is loose, and represents order of trials in a day 
M = morning = 1st transect of the day
A = afternoon = 2nd ...
E = evening = 3rd ...
N = night = 4th ...

# Recorder:
Recorder is the facilitator, i.e. the person who follows the observer pair and records the meta data

#I D
An ID number assigned per paired transects after fieldwork was completed for data cleaning

# Park.name
The name of the provincial park or protected area in British Columbia that the transects took place

# Trail.name
The name of the trail that the "on-trail" observer conducted their transect on

# Date
The date the transect took place

# Start.time
The time in PST that the transect began

# End.time
The time in PST that the transect ended

# Pictures.location
Equipment the faciliator (called recorder in this csv file) used for photographing trail habitat and datasheet

# Main.habitat.type
Dominant habitat type the observers surveyed in. 
Forest = closed canopy forest
Woodland = open canopy forest
Grassland = grasslands and shrublands

# Dominant.vegetation
The tallest vegetation with the most coverage

# Substrate
The substrate type that the "off_trail" person encountered. 
Note: this variable was not standardized between the two facilitators, so the term is qualitative.

# Trail.type
Substrate of the trail the transect took place

# Trail.width
Unit is in meters.

# Morning.Afternoon.Evening
Indicates order of the transects in one day
Morning = 1st transect of the day
Afternoon = 2nd ...
Evening = 3rd ...
Night = 4th ...

# Trail position
Indicates whether the observer was on the trail or surveying off trail

# Observer name
The observer that conducted that transect

# Trip.distance..m
This is the trip distance measured by the GPS unit for each observer (in meters). 
However, it often gave very incorrect distances traveled and showed incorrect paths the observer took when in forests or in ravines
We still measured the trip distance after we began including "straight-line" distances after May 26, 2021.

# Distance.between.start.and.finish..m
As the crow flies (straight-line) distance from start to end of a transect per observer in meters. 
Began measuring in field after May 26, 2021.

# Estimated distance
Since we updated the methods to measure distances after May 26, 2021, 
we estimated the straight line distance by measuring the distance between the first and last geotagged photo on iNaturalist for each transect on May 24 and 26, 2021
using the adehabitatLT r package to get the missing straight-line distances

# Cliffs
Whether an observer encountered the cliff (vertical rock face) mesohabitat

# Seep
Whether an observer encountered the seep (damp depression) mesohabitat

# Creek
Whether an observer encountered the creek (small running water) mesohabitat

# Water.pool
Whether an observer encountered the pool of water (standing wate) mesohabitat

# Other
This was included if the observer or facilitator found a mesohabitat not captured in the datasheet

# Total
The total number of mesohabitats encountered by the observer on the transect

# Comments
Any notable events observed by the obervers or facilitators

# obs
The number of observations made during that transect

# taxa
The number of different taxa (i.e. taxonomic richness) observed during the transect

# Est.dist.sc
The estimated distance variable scaled to a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1
